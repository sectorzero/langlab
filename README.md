# langlab
Just a lab of lang idioms for learning and taking notes

# to follow certain rules 
* code is added as callabe functions, not as 'main' and mostly driven via test suites
* working code should be checked in with full coverage
* use a build tool which is fully automated, basically we should be able to run <tool> test to run all tests
